# Site Theme SDK

The Site Theme SDK is meant to be used to simplify usage of the required APIs on a Custom Site. You can start navigating the TypeDoc documentation by clicking the `Modules` link at the top of this page. We recommend starting with the [`default Class`](classes/index.default.md) page.

Check out the Custom Sites Site Theme SDK Reference for instructions on how to get started, as well as guides on how to use the various SDK functions.
